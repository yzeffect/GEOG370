    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    <body>After loading in the Natural Earth shapefile, I modified the ESRI setting on the bottom right.
        The shape of the map would change according to different ESRI changes. After sucessfully changing
        the shapefile to the desired ESRI format, the indicatrix tool will then be utilized to graph out 
        Tissot’s indicatrix.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection (EPSG4326)</h2>
    <body>The WGS84 Projection focuses on the equator, where there are nearly no distortion at all. With
        increase in latitude, as shown in Tissot's indecatrix, the distortion also increases. Distortion
        is at it's maximum at the North Pole and South Pole. Distortion is the same across all locations
        sharing the same latitude.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection (EPSG54043)</h2>
    <body>The Aitoff Projection focuses on the Prime Meridian, where the Longitude is 0. Locations on 
        the Prime Meridian experiences little to no distortion, as the Tissot's Indecatrix shows. The 
        further away from the Prime Meridian, the more distortion there is, and distortion also increased
        with increase in latitude. In general, locations along the Prime Meridian is free from distortion,
        and locations along the Equator experiences less distortion compares to North and South Pole.
