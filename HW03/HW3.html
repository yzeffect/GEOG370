    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    <body>After loading in the Natural Earth shapefile, I modified the ESRI setting on the bottom right.
        The shape of the map would change according to different ESRI changes. After sucessfully changing
        the shapefile to the desired ESRI format, the indicatrix tool will then be utilized to graph out 
        Tissot’s indicatrix.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection (EPSG4326)</h2>
    <body>The WGS84 Projection focuses on the equator, where there are nearly no distortion at all. With
        increase in latitude, as shown in Tissot's indecatrix, the distortion also increases. Distortion
        is at it's maximum at the North Pole and South Pole. Distortion is the same across all locations
        sharing the same latitude. With this unique quality, WGS84 is the best when looking at locations
        closer to the equator.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection (EPSG54043)</h2>
    <body>The Aitoff Projection focuses on the Prime Meridian, where the Longitude is 0. Locations on 
        the Prime Meridian experiences little to no distortion, as the Tissot's Indecatrix shows. The 
        further away from the Prime Meridian, the more distortion there is, and distortion also increased
        with increase in latitude. In general, locations along the Prime Meridian is free from distortion,
        and locations along the Equator experiences less distortion compares to North and South Pole.

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection (EPSG3857)</h2>
    <body>The Pseudo-Mercator map preserves the shape of the Earth very well. As shown in the Tissot's
        Indecatrix, that are only circles and no ellipses. That means the shape are not distorted. From
        the map, we can also see that at the Equator, there are little distortion. With increasing latitude,
        the size of the circles also increases, meaning the map would look larger than it actually is.
        This kind of map will be very beneficial when navigating, as it preserves directions pretty well.

    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projection (EPSG53018)</h2>
    <body>The sphere winkel projection didn't preserve the shape, direction, nor the area. However, when
        looking at the map, you'll see it actually tries to minimize all three factors. The difference in
        area is not as significant as Pseudo-Mercator Projection, the direction is not as distorted as Aitoff
        projection, and distance is not significant as WGS84.

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection (EPSG54034)</h2>
    <body>The world cylindrical equal area projection, as its name suggests, preserves the area of the
        Earth. The tradeoff of that is the shape of the North and South pole is extremely distorted. 
        As shown on the Tissot's Indecatrix, ellipses at extreme latitudes are vertically compressed. 
        This kind of map would be useful when area is important, and the user is working with locations
        near the Equator. If one is interested in the North Pole or the South Pole, this map might not be
        the most ideal one to use.</body>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection (EPSG54027)</h2>
    <body>As the name suggests, the World Equidistant Conic Projection focuses on preserving the distance
        along the Meridian is proportionally correct. A result of this is that the map is severely
        distorted on the South Pole. The area of the South Pole is a lot larger than it actually is. 
        This map is the most useful at the North Pole as the shape/direction/area is very well preserved
        there. It might also be valuable when interested in finding out the true distance between
        two points. This map also choose its standard parallel from regions of interest, therefore allow 
        one to minimize distortion in their region of interest. The very top of the map is blank as the 
        Map is a conic projection.

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection (EPSG102016)</h2>
    <body>The Azimuthal Equidistant Projection is very similar to the one above(World Equidistant Conic
        Projection). The distance is proportionally correct from the center point. Unfortunately, only
        the center point is free from distortion. However, this map is still very useful when interested
        in finding out the true distance between two points.</body>

    <h2>Peirce Quincuncial Projection (EPSG54090)</h2>
    <body>The Peirce Quincuncial Projection transforms the northern hemisphere into a square, and the
        southern hemisphere into four triangles. The exaggeration of scale is even lower than the Mercator 
        projection. As the Tissot’s Indecatrix represents, other than the eight indicatrix on the four 
        Southern hemisphere triangles, the indicatrix are about the same size and preserves the shape
        pretty well. Unfortunately, this projection is rarely used, it's most recent use is to present
        sphere panoramas, as the most areas are recognizable. </body>

    <h2>Goode's Homolosine Projection (EPSG54052)</h2>
    <body>The Goode's Homolosine Projection preserves the shape pretty well and minimizes distortion across
        the entire map. As seen on the Tissot's indecatrix, the indicatrix are roughly normal from the North
        Pole to the South Pole. At the ripped-out locations, the indecatrix is more distorted. This map is 
        pretty accurate for land areas but it's depiction of the ocean is severely distorted.
