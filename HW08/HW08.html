<h1>Homework 8: Road Kills in California </h1>
<h2>Valen Zhang</h2>
<h3>Everytime I drive on i40, I'll see some road kills. That makes me reflect on why there are more road 
    kills at some locations than the other? This is why I decided to do explore road kills in California. 
    California has many National Parks and State Parks. In this homeowkr, I decided to study the 
    relationship between road kills and State Parks instead of National Parks because around National 
    Parks, people are generally more prudent when they're driving. On the other hand, State Parks are 
    everywhere and more spread out than the National Parks. Therefore, I believe that State Parks might 
    be something interesting to study. 

    I first imported the csv datafile for road kill data from FatalEncounters.org. Then, I imported the 
    State Park boundaries from California Open Data webpage. In QGIS, I created a 10 mile buffer and a 
    3 mile buffer from each state park. Then, using the 3 mile and 10 mile buffer, I was able to select 
    those road kills that are within those range using intersection function in QGIS. Results are shown 
    below.
