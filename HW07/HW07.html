<h1>Homework 7: Rivian Motor vs Lucid Motor Sales in California </h1>
<h2>Valen Zhang</h2>
<h3>Rivian and Lucid are two Americian EV manufacturer founded in California. While both are EVs, Rivian is 
    selling pick up truck, and Lucid focuses on luxury sedan. Since I am really interested in purchasing 
    stocks from the two companies, I decided to do a choropleth of their sales data in 2022 and see which 
    company is doing better. As Rivian Motor have larger sales data, I used Rivian as the numerator, and 
    number of Lucid Motor sales as the denominator. 

    Unfortunately, even though California is the state where they were founded, neither Lucid nor Rivian 
    sold their vehicles to all the counties in California. Therefore, as shown in the map, there are 
    some missing data marked in Orange.
